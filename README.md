# Cocos2dxWebSocket

This is a sample that shows how to use websockets using cocos2dx.

I used c++ with cocos2dx v3.10 

# Why?
Why not :)?

I was looking for a good sample that use websocket with c++ and cocos2dx and could not find one, so i made one.

# How does it work
The sample has a basic ui interface that allow to use a url for the connection

The ui have been made with Cocos Studio.

The project is compatible and have been tested on Windows 10 and android.

It can easily be used with an echo server.
